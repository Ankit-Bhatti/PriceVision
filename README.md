📈 PriceVision Predictor
Welcome to PriceVision Predictor, a machine learning project designed to predict product prices based on various features.
This was created as a learning project to practice the complete ML workflow — from data cleaning to model evaluation.

🚀 Project Overview
Goal: Build and evaluate regression models to predict prices accurately.

Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Dataset: Open-source dataset from Kaggle

Algorithms Used: Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor

🛠️ Project Workflow
Data Loading & Exploration: Understand the dataset structure.

Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical features, and normalize the data.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize data patterns and important relationships.

Model Training: Build multiple regression models and train them on the data.

Model Evaluation: Measure performance using metrics like R² score, MAE, and RMSE.

Prediction: Use the best-performing model to predict product prices.

📊 Results
Achieved an R² score of (insert your best model’s score here).

Identified key features that heavily influence price prediction.

📚 Key Takeaways
